    <p>Hi, I am George,
        I am a Software Engineer, I am 25 years old, and I live in Athens, Greece. I am passionate about building
        software with Java (aka Spring Boot). I am also a big fan of clean code and best practices. I like to use TDD
        for my projects, but I don't want to overdo it. I am trying to find the balance between the TDD and the
        deadline. My strong asset is the ability to focus on a problem and solve it quickly, efficiently, and with
        minimal effort. This is my personal portfolio and my blog too, where I share pitfalls that I have been fallen or
        any topic that I found useful. </p>
